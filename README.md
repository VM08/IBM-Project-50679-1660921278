Car Resale value Prediction

OVERVIEW 
The used car market shows great potential in the global world. The price of a new car in the industry is fixed by the manufacturer with some additional costs incurred by the government in the form of taxes. But due to the increased price of new cars and the inability of customers to buy new cars due to the lack of funds, used car sales are on a global increase. The focus of this project is developing machine learning models that can accurately predict the price of a used car based on its features, in order to make informed purchases.
MACHINE LEARNING
    	    Machine Learning is a field of technology developing with immense abilities and applications in automating tasks, where neither human intervention is needed nor explicit programming. The power of ML is so great that we can see its applications trending almost everywhere in our day-to-day lives. ML has solved many problems that existed earlier and have made businesses in the world progress to a great extent. To develop an efficient and effective model which predicts the price of a used car according to the user's inputs. 
➢ To achieve good accuracy. 
➢ To develop a User Interface( UI ) 
➢ It is user-friendly 
➢ It takes input from the user and predicts the price. 
PURPOSE
     	 There is a need for a used car price prediction system to effectively determine the worthiness of the car using a variety of features. Even though there are websites that offer this service, their prediction method may not be the best. Besides, different models and systems may contribute to predicting power for a used car in actual market value. It is important to know their actual market value while both buying and selling. By Machine learning concept , to find the best solution for car price prediction is possible.

OBJECTIVE 
Car Price Prediction project is the ability to predict the price of a used car given various attributes (data) of that car. There is a saying that a car loses 10% of its value the moment the user drives it off a lot. Given that the user would expect that one of the main predictors is the amount of miles driven in the car, since more driving wears down the car. Additionally, the user would expect the brand (make) of the car to also be a factor in the price of a used car, since some brands of cars cost more and may be better made. The user expects to encounter some issues with multidisciplinary since some aspects of cars may be highly correlated. For example, larger cars will probably have larger engines and more doors. Larger engines are correlated with more cylinders.

Description :This paper deals with the fact that the production of cars has been steadily increasing in the past decade, with over 70 million passenger cars being produced in the year 2016. This has given rise to the used car market, which on its own has become a booming industry. The recent advent of online portals has facilitated the need for both the customer and the seller to be better informed about the trends and patterns that determine the value of a used car in the market. Using Machine Learning Algorithms such as Lasso Regression, Multiple Regression and Regression trees, we will try to develop a statistical model which will be able to predict the price of a used car, based on previous consumer data and a given set of features. We will also be comparing the prediction accuracy of these models to determine the optimal one.
DEMERITS OF THE EXISTING SYSTEM: 

The data needed for the price estimation of the used cars is less in the existing system. Only variant , model, brand and the model year of the car and the estimated price of the car given by the seller are the only information given in most of the existing systems. In the existing systems, the owners of the cars code the selling price of the cars which is favorable to the owner’s hand. The satisfaction of the buyer and the seller is less and the estimated price isn’t reasonable. And the brokerage and brokers are involved in the existing systems. In the existing system, mechanics are needed to give the final estimate of the cars after the inspection. Mileage and horsepower are neglected in the price estimation data.

MERITS OF THE NEWLY PROPOSED SYSTEM: 

 The data needed for the price estimation of the used cars is more Compared to the existing system. Other than the variant , model and brand of the car , the mileage and Service records of the car is also needed for estimating price for greater accuracy . In the older or existing systems, the owners of the cars code the selling price of the cars which is favorable to the owner’s hand. The satisfaction of the both seller and buyer are more and there is no brokerage and brokers involved as an external mediator. User friendly, more reliable ,easily understandable , high accuracy in estimation of the price of used cars. There is less need for a mechanic to give a price estimate of the car after inspection. The more reasonable and best resale price is estimated through the newly proposed system which fulfills both the seller’s and buyer’s satisfaction.

FEASIBILITY STUDY FOR USED CAR PRICE PREDICTION
                  Data Science team and the development of a model that will provide the best results in revealing and preventing fraudulent transactions. This is achieved through bringing together all meaningful features of card users’ transactions, such as Date, User Zone, Product Category, Amount, Provider, Client’s Behavioral Patterns, etc. The information is then run through a trained model that finds patterns and rules so that it can classify whether a transaction is fraudulent or is legitimate.

PROJECT METHODOLOGY 
                 There are two primary phases in the system:
                                              1. Training Phase 
                                              2. Testing Phase 
Training Phase:
                      The system is trained by using the data in the data set and fits a model (line/curve) based on the algorithm chosen accordingly. 
Testing phase:
                     The system is provided with the inputs and is tested for its working. The accuracy is checked. And therefore, the data that is used to train the model or test it, has to be appropriate. The system is designed to detect and predict the price of used cars and hence appropriate algorithms must be used to do the two different tasks. Before the algorithms were selected for further use, different algorithms were compared for its accuracy. The well-suited one for the task was chosen.

 MODULE DESCRIPTION

Data Pre-Processing: 
                 Data preprocessing is a process of preparing the raw data and making it suitable for a machine learning model. It is the first and crucial step while creating a machine learning model. When creating a machine learning project, it is not always a case that we come across clean and formatted data. And while doing any operation with data, it is mandatory to clean it and put it in a formatted way. So for this, the user can use data pre-processing task
Training:
                A training model is a dataset that is used to train an ML algorithm. It consists of the sample output data and the corresponding sets of input data that have an influence on the output. The training model is used to run the input data through the algorithm to correlate the processed output against the sample output. The result from this correlation is used to modify the model.
Testing: 
             In machine learning, model testing is referred to as the process where the performance of a fully trained model is evaluated on a testing set. This kind of ML testing is more similar to traditional testing. Users can write and run tests checking the performance of the program. Applying the tests, users catch bugs in different components of the ML program. For example, users can test that the hidden layers in a neural network are configured correctly.
Random forest Regression : 
               Random Forest Regression is a supervised learning algorithm that uses ensemble learning methods for regression. Ensemble learning method is a technique that combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms to make a more accurate prediction than a single model.
Prediction:
               “Prediction” refers to the output of an algorithm .It has been trained on a historical dataset and applied to new data when forecasting the likelihood of a particular outcome. Just like a hypothesis, a prediction is a type of guess. However, a prediction is an estimation made from observations. 


                                                                   
CONCLUSION AND SCOPE FOR FUTURE WORK 

             The increased prices of new cars and the financial incapability of the customers to buy them, Used Car sales are on a global increase. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a Used Car Price Prediction system which effectively determines the worthiness of the car using a variety of features. The proposed system will help to determine the accurate price of used car price prediction . Car Price Prediction was aimed to get different perspectives and eventually compared their performance with different models. Car price prediction can be a challenging task due to the high number of attributes that should be considered for the accurate prediction. The major step in the prediction process is collection and preprocessing of the data. In this research, linear regression and lasso regression , Random forest regression were built to normalize, standardize and clean data to avoid unnecessary noise for machine learning algorithms. Data cleaning is one of the processes that increases prediction performance.
